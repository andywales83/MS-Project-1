                <p>Born in to a musical family, I have been a musician since the tender age of four years
                    old.
                </p>

                <p>I am a multi-instrumentalist and a Graduate of Cardiff University School of Music
                    where I studied and received a BA Hons in Music.</p>

                <p>Throughout my musical career, I have also achieved:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Diploma Of The London College Of Music - DipLCM in Teaching</li>
                    <li>ABRSM - Practical Grade 8 in Saxophone</li>
                    <li>RSL - Classical Piano Grade 8</li>
                    <li>LCM - Performance Award in Drums</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I have been teaching privately since 2005, and just a year later in 2006, I decided to open the
                    RCT School of Music, where I am the tutor for all musical instruments. Before going into
                    business for myself, I previously taught students at Tonypandy Community College (Peripatetic).
                </p>

                <p>I aim to provide tuition in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere, and utilise my experience in
                    teaching both the RGT and Rockschool syllabus, to help you achieve excellent results in your
                    exams, should you choose to take them</p>

                <p>I am proud to note that all of my students to date, have to date enjoyed a 100% pass rate in
                    ABRSM, RGT and Rockschool Exams</p>
