## Project Description   

RCT School of Music is a fictional website for a music school in my home town, in South Wales. The website will primarily be aimed more at general customers, however it will still need a professional look and design, along with the incorporation of user friendly but professional looking features. Features included are an overview of the tutor and their professional background, a list of the different instruments to which tutoring is being offered, an opportunity to read testimonials from current or previous learners, a clear indication of the prices and an opportunity to book a lesson or ask any questions in advance, via a contact form.

Being a musician myself, I appreciate how dificult it often is as a beginner, to find local tutors in the area, who have websites that fully detail what they offer, in a structured and comprehensive manner. This website is built with the hopes of aspiring students, having a valuable resource at hand, where they can access details of the instruments taught, the styles of music taught, how the lessons can be delivered and enough details about the tutor and their background, to encourage an informed decision to book a lesson

## Features

### Existing Features

<!-- Space for image of the navigation bar -->

- Navigation Bar
    - Featured at the top of the main home screen, the navigation bar has been coded to remain in place and does not move with the screen as the user scrolls. The navigation bar is fully responsive and structured to show the logo for the site, as well as links to the About Me, Teachings, Testimonials and Contact Form Sections.
    - the navigation bar incorprates Bootstrap 5's version of the navbar toggler, that breaks the navbar down and hides it behind the toggler at the medium breakpoint of responsiveness.

<!-- Space for image of the Hero Image and central text box -->

- Hero Image Section
    - The hero image section was designed with the idea of really influencing a user to find out more about the service. The large image of somebody holding an Acoustic Guitar was selected, to really highlight visually, the dynamic of what the site is all about. 
    - Centered in the middle of the Hero Image is a text box, that was again incorporated to really spark an interest in the service and influence a user to want to find out more. The text box was designed with the larger logo, the leading paragraph "Join us and unlock your full musical potential!" and the Contact Us! button to really draw in that initial focus of a user and instantly encourage them to make contact.

<!-- Space for image of the about me section -->

- About Me Section
    - The About Me section was created to instantly give the user a sense of association with the school's tutor. The image chosen for the tutor, was done so with the view to keeping the About Me scetion consistent with a professional but welcoming feel. 
    - The written content of the About Me section, was again written with the view to providing a professional but welcoming background, to the tutors musical experience and qualifications that could have a great influence on a potential customer, chosing to use the school's services for their musical learning.
