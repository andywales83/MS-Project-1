## Project Description   

RCT School of Music is a fictional website for a music school in my home town, in South Wales. The website will primarily be aimed more at general customers, however it will still need a professional look and design, along with the incorporation of user friendly but professional looking features. Features included are an overview of the tutor and their professional background, a list of the different instruments to which tutoring is being offered, an opportunity to read testimonials from current or previous learners, a clear indication of the prices and an opportunity to book a lesson or ask any questions in advance, via a contact form.

Being a musician myself, I appreciate how dificult it often is as a beginner, to find local tutors in the area, who have websites that fully detail what they offer, in a structured and comprehensive manner. This website is built with the hopes of aspiring students, having a valuable resource at hand, where they can access details of the instruments taught, the styles of music taught, how the lessons can be delivered and enough details about the tutor and their background, to encourage an informed decision to book a lesson
