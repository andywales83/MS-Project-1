## Project Description   

RCT School of Music is a fictional website for a music school in my home town, in South Wales. The website will primarily be aimed more at general customers, however it will still need a professional look and design, along with the incorporation of user friendly but professional looking features. Features included are an overview of the tutor and their professional background, a list of the different instruments to which tutoring is being offered, an opportunity to read testimonials from current or previous learners, a clear indication of the prices and an opportunity to book a lesson or ask any questions in advance, via a contact form.

Being a musician myself, I appreciate how dificult it often is as a beginner, to find local tutors in the area, who have websites that fully detail what they offer, in a structured and comprehensive manner. This website is built with the hopes of aspiring students, having a valuable resource at hand, where they can access details of the instruments taught, the styles of music taught, how the lessons can be delivered and enough details about the tutor and their background, to encourage an informed decision to book a lesson

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Navigation Bar**
    - Featured at the top of the main home screen, the navigation bar has been coded to remain in place and does not move with the screen as the user scrolls. The navigation bar is fully responsive and structured to show the logo for the site, as well as links to the About Me, Teachings, Testimonials and Contact Form Sections.
    - The navigation bar also incorprates Bootstrap 5's version of the navbar toggler, that breaks the navbar down and hides it behind the toggler at the medium breakpoint of responsiveness.

- Hero Image Section
    - The hero image section was designed with the idea of really influencing a user to find out more about the service. The large image of somebody holding an Acoustic Guitar was selected, to really highlight visually, the dynamic of what the site is all about. 
    - Centered in the middle of the Hero Image is a text box, that was again incorporated to really spark an interest in the service and influence a user to want to find out more. The text box was designed with the larger logo, the leading paragraph "Where you can unlock your full musical potential!" and the Contact Us! button to really draw in that initial focus of a user and instantly encourage them to make contact.

- About Me Section
    - The About Me section was created to instantly give the user a sense of association with the school's tutor. The image chosen for the tutor, was done so with the view to keeping the About Me scetion consistent with a professional but welcoming feel. 
    - The written content of the About Me section, was again written with the view to providing a professional but welcoming background, to the tutors musical experience and qualifications that could have a great influence on a potential customer, chosing to use the school's services for their musical learning.

- What I Teach Section
    - This section of the website, was built to highlight what is taught at the school. The visuals were chosen, so that a site visitor would be able to quickly identify what instruments they can learn, even if there was no textual representation of the offering.
    - The card style desings allowed for sufficient space, to add content relating to the cost of tutoring, and what styles of music a learner can choose to learn from.    

<!-- Space for the image of the What I Testimonials section -->

- Testimonials Section
    - The tesimonials section was developed, to allow users to gain insight in to the thoughts of other students, and hopefully encourage a potential customer to contact the School.
    - The section contains three sets of feedback quotes at its largest and smallest screen sizes, with one being hidden at the medium screen size for a better overall look at medium screen widths.

### Features to implement in the future

There are multiple updates that could be implemented in the future, that would add additional user benefit and would fall in line, with the scope of the goals to increase the features for frequent users.

- Implemented features could include:
    - implementation of a direct to source calendar booking system such as calendly, where learners can directly access the calendar for teh tutor, and book in a slot for a lesson from a pre-set number of days and times.
    - implementation of an alert bar, that gives users information on details such as new instruments that are being introduced to the offering. Offers that can be accessed, such as referral rates for friends and family, or reduced lesson prices through blocked bookings.
    - implementation of a new section or page that allows the tutor to create an online blog, introducing snippets of lessons, musical techniques or ideas and concepts.
    - A frequently asked questions page, where the most common questions asked by students are answered, giving potential customer a greater depth of readily available information.    
    - introduction of a monthly subscription where students can access a subscription only area with video and tutorials and downloadable content.
